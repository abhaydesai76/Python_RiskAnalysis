# Python_RiskAnalysis
Repository having python risk analysis for 2 investors, and suggesting stocks to invest based on risk appetite and exxpected return

Problem Statement – investor risk profiling and portfolio recommendation:

* There are 2 investors, mr. patrick jyenger and mr. peter jyenger, who are looking to invest their capital in stocks to meet their financial objectives.
* Mr. patrick jyenger wants to maintain decent standard of living post his retirement, and has always been a conservative investor during his life. 
He wants to invest usd 500,000 in equities and expects doubling his capital with less risk in 5 year’s time.
* Mr. peter jyenger is consistent with his attitude towards risk and prefers high-return investments. He wants to invest USD 1,000,000 and expects high returns 
to meet his future goals.
* Our task is to provide consultation to two different investors, Mr Patrick Jyenger and Mr Peter Jyenger based on their requirements and financial objectives. 

STEPS to be taken:

* Data exploration and creation of interactive visualization dashboards
* Stock analysis and portfolio management to meet financial goals
* Compare alpha, beta and sharpe ratio of stocks and come up with portfolio recommendation balancing return and risk
* Prepare an executive report summarizing all the findings, insights, visuals and recommendations 

Alpha, beta and sharpe ratio of stocks:

* Alpha shows how well or bad a stock has performed in comparison to a benchmark index. A high alpha is always good.
* Beta indicates how volatile a stock's price has been in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is a concept that measures the expected move in a stock 
relative to movements in the overall market. A beta greater than 1.0 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the broader market, and a beta less than 1.0 indicates a stock with lower volatility.
* Sharpe ratio tells investors whether an investment's returns are due to smart investment decisions or are the result of excess risk. Usually, any Sharpe ratio greater than 1.0 is considered acceptable to good by investors. A ratio higher than 2.0 is rated as very good. A ratio of 3.0 or higher is considered excellent. A ratio under 1.0 is considered sub-optimal.
* Anything more than zero is a good alpha; higher the alpha ratio in stocks on a consistent basis, higher is the potential of long term returns. Generally, beta of around 1 or less is recommended. If your stock beta is less than 1, make sure that stock alpha is high enough so that you can meet your financial goals. If you are stock beta is more than 1, then make sure that you are comfortable with the risk, as per your risk capacity.
